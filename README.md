The **Multi-Cluster MCP Server** provides a robust gateway for **Generative AI (GenAI)** systems to interact with multiple Kubernetes clusters through the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**. It facilitates comprehensive operations on Kubernetes resources, streamlined multi-cluster management, and enhanced cluster observability, all within a unified and integrated platform.

## Features

- **Kubernetes Cluster Operations**:

  - Manage Kubernetes resources such as Pods, Deployments, and Services
  - Access and retrieve logs for Kubernetes resources (Pods, Containers)
  
- **Multi-Cluster Management** (via Open Cluster Management):

  - Join and detach clusters within the multi-cluster environment
  - Interact with multi-cluster APIs, including Managed Clusters, Policies, Add-ons, and more
  
- **Cluster Observability**:

  - Retrieve and analyze metrics, logs, and alerts from integrated clusters
